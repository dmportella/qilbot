Thank you for taking your time to put this together there is just a few things we need to ensure before we can merge this.

*Qilbot* uses make to build the project everything you will need to is available there.

Typically as you develop the `make` command will run all the go tool goodness like: lint, vet, generate, fmt etc.

Before code is merge ALL issues raised by the `make` command should be resolved.

If a pull request resolves an issue please reference the issue on your pull request.
