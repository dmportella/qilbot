# Adding bot to a server

1. Get your `ApplicationID`.
2. Replace the APPID from the link below.
   * https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&permissions=0&client_id=APPID
   * The link above gives the bot the lowest level of permissions. Currently `Qilbot` doesn't require higher levels for more information about permissions check: [Discord Permissions](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#bitwise-permission-flags) - this however may change in the future.
3. Visiting this URL you will see the page below. 
   * Select which server you want your bot be and press authorise.
   * All done
